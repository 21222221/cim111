      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia. I spent fifteen years studying in an Italian school called Colegio Italiano Leonardo Da Vinci. The philosophy of the school, as it is in Italy, was that perfection is unachievable and that is why students had to work very hard to earn good grades. As hard as it seemed in the moment, studying that hard formed me into the critical thinker that I am today, plus I learned and got to live an extensive amount of the Italian culture.</p>
      <p>During the summers I traveled with my family and I went to summer camps in different cities. As I grew older I started having leadership positions in these camps and it was then that I discovered my passion for working with children. Coming to the end of my school years this is what influenced my decision to study social sciences.</p>
      <p>In 2015 I graduated high school and started studying psychology in the University of los Andes. However, as the semesters passed I felt like I was missing something in my undergraduate experience and I could not project myself working as a psychologist. In 2017 I transferred to the University of Miami to continue my studies with the willing and curiosity to discover what was missing. It was then than I started studying Sociology and fell in love with it without leaving psychology behind. On top of this, this university provided me an incredible amount of opportunities to discover where I wanted to go, and for that I am thankful. </p>
      <p>Right now, I am entering my last semester as an undergrad and I am confident that all the experiences I have had will allow me to enter this next step strong. </p>
