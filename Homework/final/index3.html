  <p>I was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia. I spent fifteen years studying in an Italian school called Colegio Italiano Leonardo Da Vinci. The philosophy of the school, as it is in Italy, was that perfection is unachievable and that is why students had to work very hard to earn good grades. As hard as it seemed in the moment, studying that hard formed me into the critical thinker that I am today, plus I learned and got to live an extensive amount of the Italian culture.</p>
  <p>During the summers I traveled with my family and I went to summer camps in different cities. As I grew older I started having leadership positions in these camps and it was then that I discovered my passion for working with children. Coming to the end of my school years this is what influenced my decision to study social sciences.</p>
