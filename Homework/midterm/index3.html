      <p>Traveling has always been an important part of my life. Since a young age, it has provided me with experiences that have opened my mind and help me see the world in a different way.</p>
      <p>This summer I jumped to South East Asia, as a volunteer and backpacker, to discover something I have never seen before. With high expectations and an open mind, my five-week adventure marked my life.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #ff6666; font-size: 30px">Laos</h1>
    <p>My first encounter with Laos was fantastic. Afew days in Luang Prabang gave me a taste of the culture of this city. However, it was in Sop Chem, a small village that I learned the most about Laos people and traditions.</p>
    <p>It was here, in this 321 people vilage that I spent my time volunteering and participating in the daily life activities that these people have practice for centuries.</p>

      <h1 style="color: #ff6666; font-size: 30px">Vietnam</h1>
      <p>I had the opportunity to discover this country in all its length. My adventure started on the North, in Hanoi, Sapa, and Halong Bay. Then I moved to the middle to Hue and Hoi An. I finished in the cahotic capital, Saigon.</p>
      <p>Since you enter this country you can see its diversity and richness. Having survived centuries of wars, Vietnamese are the most resilient people I have ever met.</p>
