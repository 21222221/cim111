      <p>During my time here I was surrounded by locals and my fellow volunteers. We all were there because we believed in the same project and having that as motivation to work together made our relationship stronger.</p>
      <p>Since the moment I arrived the locals made me feel like home. Their kindness, curiosity, and engagement allowed me to have a relationship with them in which we both learned from each other.</p>

    <p>Learning English in Laos provides locals with more work opportunities since they are able to perform many jobs in which it is required interaction with foreigners.</p>
    <p>During the summer volunteers teach English to the local children and women. With different level groups volunteers develop daily programs that engage and teach the children, who each year get better at English. </p>

      <p>Sop Chem people are auto suppliers, they cultivate their food, they fish, they make their own wine, they eat their animals... They are connected with nature and depend on it to survive</p>
      <p>The women weave, educate the children, and cook. They also are the motor of the village, since they maintain the economy going and establish relationships with tourists.</p>
